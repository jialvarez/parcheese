### TODO LIST ###

### DOCUMENTATION
- Design diagram of classes and modules (Xmind?).
- Document all the existing classes and methods! (at least)

### FEATURES
## General
- Accessibility version for disabled people.
- Make game.py a python script for running it as (./game.py).
- Change the name of game.py to parcheese_console.py. Move the rest of files
  to src folder.
- Once the game is started if one player wants to restart the game a petition
  must be send to the others players and act adequately 
- The turns of the player must be assigned by color and no by insertion order

## Checker
- When a checker arrives to nirvana throw the signal [C1].

## Player
- Listen signal [C1] from checkers -> Check if all checkers are in nirvana.
  In this case throw the signal winner [P1].
- If the user try to select a checker that is in Nirvana throw a warning
  message (Currently the application ends).

## Game
- Listen signal [P1] from players. End the game when received. 

## Table
- Change Table.playerMoves() to Table.playerTurn(). In the actual method you
  need to specify the checker to move before the dice is thrown. In the real
  life you first throw the dice and the decide which checker to move.
